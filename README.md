* The Course AE5335 offered by Prof. Raghvendra V. Cowlagi focuses on the whole autonomy stack of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ranging fron multirotoes to fixed wings.
* The Course is well designed an seamlessly guids throuch each layer of the autonomy stack.
* The assignment based approach of the course makes easy for the student to understand algorithms taught and also gives a grasp of how tricky it can be to applu those on the real world problem.
* The course guides through the following autonomy stack.

* The Repo contains solutions to the three matlab assignments offered durng the course with a detailed report and derivations.
* The first assignment focuses on the top most layer of the autonomy stack. State Estamation, Sensor Fusion using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Localization.
* The Second assignment focuses on the middle layer of the autonomy stack. Path Planning and Trajectory Planning.
* The Third and last assignment focuses on the last and final layer, Inverse Dynamics and Controls.
